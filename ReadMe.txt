Thanks for checking out my demonstration repository.

This repository is a demonstration one of a few projects of various types that were done of the years to meet manufacturing needs as things moved along.

Video Folder:
 * This folder contains live demonstrations of a few of my programs in various formats(WPF/Winform/React/C#/Typescript/VB.Net)

Source Code Folder - Some demo code that was done:
 * Lib_Deprag(Recent)
    - A Standard VB Library for general machine implementation use(Communicating over Ethernet/IP as a cost reduction to another integrator)
 * Station_Sentinel(Slightly more recent)
    - A distributed machine level logging and interface system for manufacturing using an ASP.Net backend with a Typescript Frontend for manufacturing information.
    - Also contains planning documentation and a program to generate test code based on a machines integrated logs.
    - Has email capabilities and serving items over blob formats similar to Azure uses.
 * PressMate(Old) - 
    - An old program that was done for one of our individual cells with animated graphics and text for manufacturing using OPC-DA in Winform.
